Classwork - JavaScript Basics

Create an HTML file called ```index.html`` 

Add JavaScript inline (using <script> tags) that does the following:

* Defines a string variable called ```name``` and assign it your name

* Defines a numeric variable called ```age``` that contains your age

* Write the code to log ```My name is YOURNAME and I am YOURAGE``` in the developer console
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>ClassWork</title>

<body>
<script>
    var name="Shoshard"
    var age=21
    console.log("My name "+name+" and I am "+age)
</script>
